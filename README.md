 ### Why did we choose this project?

A 2016 study out of Hong Kong, <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/25/5/839/71066/Cancer-Mortality-Risks-from-Long-term-Exposure-to">Cancer Mortality Risks from Long-term Exposure to Ambient Fine Particle</a>,  showed that long-term exposure to pollution rates of PM2.5 (ambient fine particulate matter) are associated with a higher risk of cancer in various organs. In fact, the study showed that for every 10 µg/m3 of increased PM2.5 exposure the risk of dying from cancer rose 22%.

Our team's interest and experience in community health, and the environmental concerns that affect it, are what led us to create this project.

What questions we hope to answer:
<BR>
• Are cancer rates affected by environmental pollutants
<BR>
• Are specific years more impactful than others
