# Machine Learning Model
## Segment 1: Model Mock Up
<BR>
The model_data_ML_Mock.xlsx is the mock up of ther machine learning model inputs and outputs. The goal of the Machine Leanring Model is to ingest the inputs of all counties IDs/FIPS along with the max, min, and mean values for both air pollutants (PM) and Ozone (oz) and the cancer incidence trends associated for years 2001-2014. The model will then predict and output future trends of cancer incidence for each location. 
<BR>
Questions Machine Model will answer:
<BR>
• Do the levels of air particulate matter affect the number of cancer instances in the United States?
<BR>
• Is the rate of cancer incidence in counties with more pollution higher than in those with moderate and lower PM rates?
<BR>
• Are specific years more impactful than others?
<BR>
## Machine Learning Model Selection
<BR>
The input data is labeled so a supervised learning model was selected. To answer the questions a classification is the best fit. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was then considered upon because of it's ability to analyze the data and label the proper class.
